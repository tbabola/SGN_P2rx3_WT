function [dFoF, Fo, img] = normalizeGridImg(img, percentile, positiveIndices)
%normalizeImg Normalizes image based on percentile chosen after bleach correction. 
%   On a block by block basis, Fo is created by taking the pixel value at
%   the xth percentile. This is subtracted off of the original image; the
%   resulting image is then divided by Fo.
